st.header("About This Tool")
st.markdown(f"""
This application provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting files
using the robust **OpenSSL** library.

It utilizes the `{ENCRYPTION_CIPHER}` cipher with **PBKDF2** key derivation for enhanced security.
This means passwords are cryptographically stretched, making them harder to brute-force.

**Key Features:**
*   Easy file selection via browsing or drag-and-drop.
*   Encryption and Decryption modes.
*   Preview functionality for both input and output files (where possible).
*   Secure password handling within the browser (password is not stored long-term).
*   Downloadable encrypted/decrypted files.

**Disclaimer:**
*   Ensure you are using this tool responsibly and ethically.
*   **Crucially, remember your password!** There is no way to recover a file if the password is lost.
*   Compatibility is highest for files encrypted and decrypted using this tool or the exact same OpenSSL command-line parameters (`{ENCRYPTION_CIPHER}` with `-pbkdf2`).
*   While this tool aims to be secure, passing passwords directly to subprocesses has inherent risks compared to truly interactive prompts. Use in trusted environments.

        Please ensure OpenSSL is installed on the system running this Streamlit app
        and that the `{OPENSSL_COMMAND}` executable is accessible in the system's PATH.

        You might need to install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`)
        or download it from the official OpenSSL website.
