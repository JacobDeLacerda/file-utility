st.header("About This App")
st.markdown(f"""
This application provides user-friendly tools for common file security and manipulation tasks,
leveraging standard command-line utilities like **OpenSSL** and **Zip**.

**Available Tools (Select from Sidebar):**

1.  **Encrypt Decrypt Tool:**
    *   Uses OpenSSL's `{ENCRYPTION_CIPHER}` cipher with PBKDF2 for strong file encryption/decryption.
    *   Ideal for securing individual files with a password.

2.  **Zip File Tool:**
    *   Creates password-protected ZIP archives using the system's `zip` command (`-e` flag).
    *   Suitable for bundling and protecting files with standard ZIP encryption. *(Note: Standard ZIP encryption is generally considered less secure than AES used in the Encrypt/Decrypt tool)*.

**General Features:**
*   Easy file selection via browsing or drag-and-drop.
*   Clear interface for performing operations.
*   Secure password handling within the browser session.
*   Downloadable output files.

**Important Considerations & Disclaimers:**
*   Ensure you are using these tools responsibly and ethically.
*   **Crucially, remember your passwords!** There is no way to recover a file if the password is lost for either encryption or ZIP protection.
*   Encryption compatibility is highest for files encrypted and decrypted using the Encrypt/Decrypt tool or the exact same OpenSSL parameters.
*   The ZIP tool relies on standard `zip` encryption, which may have compatibility variations and is less robust than modern AES encryption.
*   **Security Note:** For automation, both tools pass passwords non-interactively to their respective command-line utilities. This might expose the password temporarily in the system's process list. Use with caution in shared or untrusted environments.

        Please ensure the missing command-line utilities are installed on the system running this Streamlit app
        and are accessible in the system's PATH.

        *   **OpenSSL:** Usually available on macOS/Linux. Install via package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `brew`) or from [OpenSSL website](https://www.openssl.org/).
        *   **Zip:** Usually available on macOS/Linux. Install via package manager if missing (e.g., `sudo apt install zip`, `sudo yum install zip`).

        The application may not function correctly until these are installed.
